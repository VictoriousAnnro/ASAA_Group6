**-- Use cases --**

We use the example presented in the exercises/lectures (See lecture 2 - complex systems page 14 on Itslearning)

Assumptions:
- We assume that once a production run starts, the product is assembled solely by robots. There are no humans involved in the physical assembly of products.
- We assume a single factory has multiple assembly stations (i.e. magnetic transport tracks and production cells), as well as multiple mobile robots (for delivering materials)
- We assume the system might face the following challenges:
	* Hardware failure
	* Deadlocks (i.e. failed coordination in production)
	* Internet outage
	* Physical products get stuck, blocking the system
	* System is hacked
	* Messages between components are lost (communication fails)

-- Use cases --
Use Case Name: Abort production run
Actors: Production Manager, Production Scheduler
Preconditions: Production is running
Steps:
1. Production Manager logs into the production software.
2. Production Manager selects the ”Manage Production Run” option.
3. Production Scheduler fetches overview of production
4. Production Manager selects the ”Stop Production Run” option.
5. Production Scheduler confirms the abort, and notifies related components
6. Components abort their current tasks, and return to default state.
Postconditions: Production run is aborted, and all affected components return to default state.

Use Case Name: Check status of active production run
Actors: Production Manager,
Preconditions: Production is running
Steps:
1. Production Manager logs into the production software.
2. Production Mangager selects "Check status" option.
3. Production Manager fetches a status on the production and verifies it.
Postconditions: Production continues running, without interruptions. 

Use Case Name: Schedule maintenance
Actors: Production Manager, Production Scheduler
Preconditions: Production is running
Steps:
1. Production Manager logs into the production software.
2. Production Manager selects the ”Manage Production Run” option.
3. Production Scheduler fetches overview of production
4. Production Manager selects the ”Schedule Maintenance” option.
5. Production Scheduler confirms the date, and notifies related components.
Postconditions: Components continue running, until the scheduled maintenance date.
