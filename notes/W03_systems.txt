Exercises 3

1. Identifying Systems and Sub-systems

Examine context (important details):
- Hardware components need to be available 24/7 
- Software components need to be available 24/7
- Some sort of authorization component (example: an engineer may not create production orders, but can schedule maintenance)



Identify systems & sub-systems: 
*Evaluate and choose a method for system and subsystem communication.*

--Enterprise Systems--
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
Purpose: Manage orders, supply chain, and financials
Subsystems: Order management, inventory management

PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)
Purpose: Manage BOMs, and variants
Subsystems: Version control, change management

--Production Management Systems--
MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
Purpose: Coordinate production runs, track Work in Progress
Subsystems: Scheduling, order management

APS (Advanced Planning & Scheduling)
Purpose: Optimize production sequences and resource allocation.
Subsystems: Sequencer, constraint solver, simulation engine.

--Shop-Floor Control Systems--
Automation & Control Layer
Purpose: Execute operations via industrial controllers.
Subsystems: PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), HMI (Human-Machine Interfaces).

Robotics & Actuation
Purpose: Physical assembly, handling, welding, painting.
Subsystems: Robot controllers, actuators, conveyors.

--Security & Compliance Systems--
Purpose: Ensure safe and authorized operation of the factory
Subsystems: Authentication & RBAC, audit logging, network segmentation, intrusion detection

--Integration & Data Systems--
Middleware
Purpose: Bridge OT and IT layers.
Subsystems:

Data Management
Purpose: Store, process, and analyze data.
Subsystems: 

- Internet of things (like drone communication)
- Production Management System
- Supply Chain Management System
- Advanced Robotics and Automation (robot arms, production orders, etc.)
- Database 
  - different databases (one for production orders, one for logs, etc.)

--Meeting 22nd September--
- Data Management System
  * Data Storage subsystem
  * Data Security subsystem (to authenticate the user requesting something with the data)**

- Production Management System
  * Scheduling Subsystem
  * Monitoring Subsystem (maybe something about the VIN-number assigned to each car. Monitoring machines and/or status of each car)
  * Customer Reporting (keep track of customers' order, and notify customer when order is ready)

- Web Service System
  * Web Application subsystem (the website the customer uses)

Questions:
- Use case, is the current focus correct? We're focusing a lot on production and the production manager as an actor. Only one use case with customer.
Do they cover the scope we need for this architecture?
- use case, do we need to specify the modification the customer makes to the product?
- QAs with ?-marks 
- Our current identified systems & sub-systems, are they correct? Are we going in the right direction? Are we abstracting/simplifying too much, do we need more detail or not?
- Do we need more systems & sub-systems, or are our current enough?
- When is something 'big enough' to be considered a subsystem, rather than just a feature of the system? Fx the security subsystem - should we have that as a subsystem?
