% Intro
The rapid adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies has transformed traditional automotive manufacturing into intelligent and automated production systems. However, many existing car manufacturing systems are constrained by legacy architectures that limit responsiveness, performance transparency when handling complex customized orders.
% Gap
Most related work, which primarily addresses functional and structural aspects of Industry 4.0 architectures, this study focuses on early-stage performance measurement as a core architectural concern.    
% Aim 
This project presents a software architecture for an Industry 4.0 enabled automated car manufacturing system designed to support fast and flexible processing of customer-specific vehicle configurations.
% Method
The proposed architecture contains a client-facing web application for order customization. A prototype implementation was developed to validate the architectural design, and experimental evaluations were conducted to measure performance characteristics during the architecture development phase.
% Results 
The results show that the proposed architecture is able to meet the required performance targets under stable operating conditions. The system processes messages with very low delay, continues to operate reliably when orders are created continuously, and allows the scheduler to handle incoming orders fast enough to stay within the defined limits. Overall, these results show that using automated and repeatable performance testing early in the design of Industry 4.0 software architectures is a practical and effective approach.

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
%Introduction and motivate the problem

The structure of the paper is as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:problem} outlines the research question and the research approach. 
%to analyze the research question and evaluate our results.
Section \ref{sec:related_work} describes similar work in the field and how our contribution fits the field.
Section \ref{sec:use_case} presents a production reconfiguration use case.
The use case serves as input to specify a reconfigurability QA requirement in Section \ref{sec:qas}.
Section \ref{sec:middleware_architecture} introduces the proposed reconfigurable middleware software architecture design.
Section \ref{sec:evaluation} evaluates the proposed middleware on realistic equipment in the I4.0 lab and analyzes the results against the stated QA requirement.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}
This Section addresses existing contributions by examining xxx in the I4.0 domain. 
In total, x papers are investigated. 

In \cite{Wan2019Reconfigurable}, experiences are elaborated on a three-layer architecture of a reconfigurable smart factory for drug packing in healthcare I4.0. 

The paper \cite{Yazen2010Ontology} proposes an ontology agent-based architecture for inferring  new configurations to adapt to changes in manufacturing requirements and/or environment.

In \cite{Leitao2016Specification,Angione2017Integration} an architecture for a reconfigurable production system is specified.
Two objectives for reconfiguration and how they can be reached are described.

Several papers \cite{Koren1999Reconfigurable,Koren2010Design,Bortolini2018Reconfigurable} describe reconfigurable manufacturing systems that are cost-effective and responsive to market changes.

All contributions provide valuable knowledge about reconfiguration but lack a study of the software architecture perspective that specifies a quantifiable reconfigurability architectural requirement, a software architecture that adopts the architectural requirements, and evaluates the architectural requirement.
