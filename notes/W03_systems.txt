Exercises 3

1. Identifying Systems and Sub-systems

Examine context (important details):
- Hardware components need to be available 24/7 
- Software components need to be available 24/7
- Some sort of authorization component (example: an engineer may not create production orders, but can schedule maintenance)



Identify systems & sub-systems: 
*Evaluate and choose a method for system and subsystem communication.*
- Internet of things (like drone communication)
- Production Management System
- Supply Chain Management System
- Advanced Robotics and Automation (robot arms, production orders, etc.)
- Database 
  - different databases (one for production orders, one for logs, etc.)
