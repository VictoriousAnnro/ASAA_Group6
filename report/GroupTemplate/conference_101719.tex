\section{Introduction and Motivation}
%Introduction and motivate the problem

The structure of the paper is as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:problem} outlines the research question and the research approach. 
%to analyze the research question and evaluate our results.
Section \ref{sec:related_work} describes similar work in the field and how our contribution fits the field.
Section \ref{sec:use_case} presents a production reconfiguration use case.
The use case serves as input to specify a reconfigurability QA requirement in Section \ref{sec:qas}.
Section \ref{sec:middleware_architecture} introduces the proposed reconfigurable middleware software architecture design.
Section \ref{sec:evaluation} evaluates the proposed middleware on realistic equipment in the I4.0 lab and analyzes the results against the stated QA requirement.   

\section{Problem and Approach}

\label{sec:problem}
% What is the problem* to be solved with the reliable architecture you build, and how will the problem be addressed. *The stated problem leads to the stated research question.
\emph{Problem.}
%AM
In todays society, there is a heavy focus on the automation and digitalization of complex systems. The complex systems are used in many areas, such as industry, healthcare, public transport and so on. These systems are described as complex, because of the many parts involved, the intricate ways in which those parts communicate, and the overall behavior of the system - how do all these parts work together to complete the systems' goals? To ensure the correctness and reliability of such systems, it is of outmost importance that thought is put into the design. After all, failure in a system can lead to negative consequences ranging from minor inconviniences to death[SOURCE].\\
The Industry 4.0 production (I4.0) domain [... need to define]. In this domain there exist many complex production systems, one of which is the production of cars. Cars are sold not only for their functionality as a vehicle of transport, but often offer the customers a range of options for customization. These range from functional (such as the engine) to cosmetic (such as the color). Building a system that can handle customer orders and organize production of the placed orders is no small feat. It is one thing to design an architecture for such a system, but how does one ensure that it fulfills the requirements? Changes to the system during later parts of the development process are much more costly than changes made earlier in the process. Therefore it is important to ensure that the architecture is designed well, before implementation starts. From this, we've created these research questions:
\emph{Research questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  How to design software architecture that adopts defined architectural requirements?
    \item How to evaluate the architectural requirements?
    \item What trade-offs arise from the choosen technologies?
    \item ...smth how effective is our architecture in ensuring the desired quality attributes?** PROLLY DELETE THIS
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Approach.}
The following steps are taken to answer this paper's research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DO LATER
\end{enumerate}


\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}
% ... Should review the state of the art consisting of 8-10 papers and should contextualize how this study provides new knowledge to the field. 
This Section addresses existing contributions by examining xxx in the I4.0 domain. 
In total, x papers are investigated. 

In \cite{Wan2019Reconfigurable}, experiences are elaborated on a three-layer architecture of a reconfigurable smart factory for drug packing in healthcare I4.0. 

The paper \cite{Yazen2010Ontology} proposes an ontology agent-based architecture for inferring  new configurations to adapt to changes in manufacturing requirements and/or environment.

In \cite{Leitao2016Specification,Angione2017Integration} an architecture for a reconfigurable production system is specified.
Two objectives for reconfiguration and how they can be reached are described.

Several papers \cite{Koren1999Reconfigurable,Koren2010Design,Bortolini2018Reconfigurable} describe reconfigurable manufacturing systems that are cost-effective and responsive to market changes.

All contributions provide valuable knowledge about reconfiguration but lack a study of the software architecture perspective that specifies a quantifiable reconfigurability architectural requirement, a software architecture that adopts the architectural requirements, and evaluates the architectural requirement. 


\section{Use Case}
\label{sec:use_case}
% From lecture 12 Summary-keypoint-exam topics sample: 
% Unfold the problem with a use case and describe what the use case is about
% So i dont think we need all our use cases. Just one or a few relevant ones
This Section introduces the use case of a customer placing an order on the company's website. This use case covers the sequence of actions starting from the customer accessing the website, to the moment when the order is saved and marked as 'ready' for production in the system.
\subsection{Customer places an order}
Actors: Customer, Website, Production Scheduler
Preconditions: Available cars and customization options have been defined in database.
Steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Customer accesses company website
    \item Customer chooses preferred car
    \item Website fetches available customization options for chosen car
    \item Customer chooses preferred customizations
    \item Customer places the order
    \item Website sends order details to the Scheduler
    \item Production Scheduler recieves order details from website
    \item Production Scheduler breaks down the order into a JSON production recipe, which is then stored in the database
    \item Production Scheduler stores the order in the database, marked as 'ready'
\end{itemize}
Postconditions: A customer order is stored and marked as 'ready' for production.

\section{Quality Attribute Scenario}
\label{sec:qas}
% The use case is the foundation to describe and specify architectural requirements.
% So im assuming that means we dont include all QAs, just the ones relevant for our usecase and/or experiment?
This Section introduces the specified x QASes.
The QASes are developed based on the use case.

\section{Design and Analysis Modelling}
\label{sec:design_and_analysis_modelling}
Design and analysis modelling.
% Description of the overall architecture designs
% Argue for tactics used to archieve the QASes
% Discuss the trade-offs
%AM
% Use cases -> RQs -> feature model -> architectural model/SM?
%feature model is optional. However, it should be xplained what/which particular features (characteristics) are selected and the reason of choise.
%describe the design and argue for the design decision and how it meets the QASes. Part of the design decision must specify which tactics/patterns are used (provide arguments) and the trade-offs. 
%analyse the design and illustrate the system architecture model, encompassing both structure and behavior, using formal reasoning

\section{Formal verification and validation}
\label{sec:formal_v_and_v}
Formal verification and validation of system(s).


\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

% Empirical evaluation
This Section describes the evaluation of the proposed design.
Section \ref{sec:design} introduces the design of the experiment to evaluate the system. 
Section \ref{sec:measurements} identifies the measurements in the system for the experiment.
Section \ref{sec:pilot_test} describes the pilot test used to compute the number of replication in the actual evaluation. 
Section \ref{sec:analysis} presents the analysis of the results from the experiment.
