Exercises 3

1. Identifying Systems and Sub-systems

Examine context (important details):
- Hardware components need to be available 24/7 
- Software components need to be available 24/7
- Some sort of authorization component (example: an engineer may not create production orders, but can schedule maintenance)



Identify systems & sub-systems: 
*Evaluate and choose a method for system and subsystem communication.*

--Enterprise Systems--
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
Purpose: Manage orders, supply chain, and financials
Subsystems: Order management, inventory management

PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)
Purpose: Manage BOMs, and variants
Subsystems: Version control, change management

--Production Management Systems--
MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
Purpose: Coordinate production runs, track Work in Progress
Subsystems: Scheduling, order management

APS (Advanced Planning & Scheduling)
Purpose: Optimize production sequences and resource allocation.
Subsystems: Sequencer, constraint solver, simulation engine.

--Shop-Floor Control Systems--
Automation & Control Layer
Purpose: Execute operations via industrial controllers.
Subsystems: PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), HMI (Human-Machine Interfaces).

Robotics & Actuation
Purpose: Physical assembly, handling, welding, painting.
Subsystems: Robot controllers, actuators, conveyors.

--Security & Compliance Systems--
Purpose: Ensure safe and authorized operation of the factory
Subsystems: Authentication & RBAC, audit logging, network segmentation, intrusion detection

--Integration & Data Systems--
Middleware
Purpose: Bridge OT and IT layers.
Subsystems:

Data Management
Purpose: Store, process, and analyze data.
Subsystems: 

- Internet of things (like drone communication)
- Production Management System
- Supply Chain Management System
- Advanced Robotics and Automation (robot arms, production orders, etc.)
- Database 
  - different databases (one for production orders, one for logs, etc.)

--Meeting 22nd September--
- Data Management System
  * Data Storage subsystem
  //////* Data Security subsystem (to authenticate the user requesting something with the data)** more like a quality of system.

- Production Management System
  * Scheduling Subsystem (keep track of which machine does what and when)
    *Drone Subsystem (up to you, depending on how you make it. You decide level of abstraction. You can facilitate the experiment on the level you choose. You can focus on the machines, like 10 subsystems in a machine, or you can do high-level where you see the entire production floor as your system. One group last year did a juice machine, where they just focused on one juice machine. Each system was a part of the machine, like a peeler-system and such)
    * Robotarm Subsystems
  * Monitoring Subsystem (Monitoring each component of the system, so like the drone, and the robot arms. ...maybe something about the VIN-number assigned to each car. Monitoring machines and/or status of each car)
  ///////* Customer Reporting (keep track of customers' order, and notify customer when order is ready) - if it has an impact on architectural idea, then its a good idea to keep, otherwise out of scope

- Web Service System
  * Web Application subsystem (the website the customer uses) (if not significant for the architecture you want to raise, then just simulate web appl, like a json script)
(how strict are they abt 3 primary? ask the lecturer. TA says sub-subsystem might be complex enough but not sure)

Questions:
- Use case, is the current focus correct? We're focusing a lot on production and the production manager as an actor. Only one use case with customer.
Do they cover the scope we need for this architecture?
- use case, do we need to specify the modification the customer makes to the product?
- QAs with ?-marks 
- Our current identified systems & sub-systems, are they correct? Are we going in the right direction? Are we abstracting/simplifying too much, do we need more detail or not?
- Do we need more systems & sub-systems, or are our current enough?
- When is something 'big enough' to be considered a subsystem, rather than just a feature of the system? Fx the security subsystem - should we have that as a subsystem?
