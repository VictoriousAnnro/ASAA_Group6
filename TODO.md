## TODO Report
This is a TODO-list for random things we need fixed in the report.

1. Everyone should add their name and details to author list

2. Problem And Approach needs to be finished. Sources and some text is missing. Also 'approach' section. 

3. Related Work needs to be fully re-written. We need to make it about OUR case, and we need literature. We can use stuff from the course. 

4. QA scenarios we should discuss together, to make sure they represent what we're gonna be testing, and whether we need both of them or not.

5. Discuss requirements. I'm unsure if there's a systematic way to create reqs from QAses, and what exact data the table should contain (ID i know for sure!)

6. Fix label for requirements table. 

7. Rewrite tactics. We should try to match it to the tactics in the book.

8. Feature diagram, change 'save order' to 'Order status'

9. Structural analysis model, write that it only shows the scheduler (teacher said in class that it's ok to only show FAA for some part of the system, because that shows you understand how to do it)

10. Structural analysis model, update model with stuff 'inside' inner boxes. Check teachers soda machine example

11. Design and draw the finite-state automata. Systematic way to do it?

12. Technologies, design patterns are something totally different than the technologies we use. Find actual design patterns we use, if any

13. Technologies, im not sure where we should put the stuff about technologies. Its not made clear in the report format in lecture 12

14. Formal verification, we need to update UPPAAL model to fit our state machine. Also need to define properties to test --> then test them --> write results & improvements

15. Formal verification, cite UPPAAL
