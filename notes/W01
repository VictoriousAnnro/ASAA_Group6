**--- Notes from W01 exercises ---**

What details do we think would be important for setting up Use Cases?
* What are the users of the system?
* Communication between different parts of the system. Also local vs. remote communication.
* How are the qualities (dependability, trustworthiness etc.) guaranteed? Is the workflow 'checked' somewhere?
* Which components are responsible for coordination, and how do they do it?
* How does the system handle errors?
**What about optimization? Is this part of the general workflow? Is it relevant for Use Case? Ask TA about this.
