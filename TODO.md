## TODO Report
This is a TODO-list for random things we need fixed in the report.

**Note the folder drawioFiles. We should keep our updated drawio files in there, so we can all access easily. Im having trouble w saving to my google drive, so i prefer this**

1. Everyone should add their name and details to author list

2. Problem And Approach needs to be finished. Sources and some text is missing. Also 'approach' section. 

6. Fix label for requirements table. 

9. Structural analysis model, write that it only shows the scheduler (teacher said in class that it's ok to only show FAA for some part of the system, because that shows you understand how to do it)

10. Structural analysis model, update model with stuff 'inside' inner boxes. Check teachers soda machine example

16. State machines, initial and exit states need correct black color. For some reason it just wouldnt work for me

19. Design and analysis, should prolly have some mapping between requirements and diagrams. Consider requirement mapping matrix
